📊 Mapping the Educational Landscape  
This project aims to analyze and visualize the higher education landscape in India using real-world data. It covers aspects such as institutional types (government vs. private), course availability, fee structures, and infrastructure metrics to uncover patterns and disparities across regions.

🧠 Project Objective    
To build a comprehensive understanding of India’s educational system by collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can benefit students, educators, and policy-makers in making informed decisions.

🔍 Key Features    
✅ Web scraping of educational data from platforms like Careers360  
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy  
✅ Visualization of insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
✅ Comparative analysis of:  
Government vs. Private institutions  
Fee structures by course and region  
Availability of infrastructure facilities  
✅ Identification of regional disparities and educational gaps  

⚙️ Technologies Used   
Python  
Pandas, NumPy  
BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)  
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
Jupyter Notebook
